# PEF-NDIS Provider Manifest

The manifest for the **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider defines its contract with an ETW Controller in terms of the events that are issued by the provider, which are in turn consumed by Message Analyzer. The **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider and its manifest are installed and registered on your machine when you install Message Analyzer. You can find the **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider manifest file in the following location:  
  
 `C:\Windows\System32\Microsoft-Pef-NDIS-PacketCapture.man`  
  
 In this file you can view the event definitions, tasks, opcodes, keyword bitmask and level specifiers, a channel definition, and template information.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You will find the Microsoft-Pef-NDIS-PacketCapture.man file in the specified location only after installing Message Analyzer on computers that are running the Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows Server 2012 operating system.
