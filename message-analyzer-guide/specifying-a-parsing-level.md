# Specifying a Parsing Level

If you are loading large traces into Message Analyzer, you might consider setting a built-in **Parsing Level** to improve performance.  Because **Parsing Level** scenarios typically limit how far up the message stack Message Analyzer will parse, you can reduce the overall number of messages processed and dramatically improve performance. Also, by choosing a **Parsing Level**, you can create a more targeted message set to improve your analytical focus. This is because most **Parsing Level** scenarios contain predefined filters that are beneficial to message analysis at the top stack level on which any particular **Parsing Level** scenario creates focus.
