# Message Analyzer Feature Summary

Microsoft Message Analyzer contains a broad and versatile range of features that build upon and exceed many of those of its predecessor, Microsoft Network Monitor. These features are designed to improve your usability experiences and to expand your capabilities set when loading, capturing, analyzing, and troubleshooting message traffic with Message Analyzer. The following provides a summary of these features that is broken down according to the means by which you can access them.

<a name="BKMK_GlobalMenus"></a>
## Global Menus

 Message Analyzer provides  global menus for quick access to various features that you will regularly use. The global menu names are located in the upper-left section of the Message Analyzer user interface and are described in the following sections:

 **File Menu**
The global Message Analyzer **File** menu provides access to the features described in the list that follows.

-   **[New Session](starting-a-message-analyzer-session.md)**  — click this item to open the **New Session** dialog, from where you can choose a source from which to acquire data; for example a **Live Trace** or saved **Files**. Clicking the **New Session** item also displays a submenu that contains various items that determine what type of session you will start. With the exception of the first two bullet items immediately below, the remaining submenu items also appear in the **New Session** dialog as **Data Source** buttons that you can click to begin the configuration of a new session, based on the type of input message data you want to acquire:

    -   **Blank Session** — opens the **New Session** dialog from where you can select a data source under **Add Data Source** to use as input to Message Analyzer.

    -   **From Current Session** — opens the **New Session** dialog to a new session configuration that derives configuration settings from the current in-focus session.

    -   **[Live Trace](configuring-a-live-trace-session.md)**  — opens the **New Session** dialog with the **Live Trace** tab selected, from where you can specify one or more target computers on which to capture data; select a built-in **Trace Scenario** from the scenario Library; and configure various provider settings and filters to customize your trace configuration before starting a live trace. The **New Session** dialog also enables you to specify global session settings such as a **Session Filter**, **Start With** data viewer selection, and **Parsing Level**.<br />You also have the capability to run multiple concurrent Live Trace Sessions with different message providers on different target computers by adding one or more **Live Trace** input sources by clicking the **New Data Source** tab and specifying the hosts from which to capture the data. You can also use a single session with a specified message provider to collect data from multiple specified host machines.

  > [!NOTE]
  >  If you intend to *capture* messages that are encrypted with the Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security rotocols, for example, HTTPS and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) messages, you have the option to enable any Live Trace Session for *Decryption** so that you can view the decrypted data along with decryption session statistics. For more information, see [Decrypting TLS and SL Encrypted Data](decrypting-tls-and-ssl-encrypted-data.md).

  - **[Files](configuring-a-data-retrieval-session.md)**  — opens the **New Session** dialog with the **Files** tab selected, from where you can configure a Data Retrieval Session to acquire data that exists in one or more saved files. You can also select specific data to retrieve from such sources by using filters, for example a **Time Filter** and/or **Session Filter**.

    A **Truncated Parsing** check box is also included in the **Files** tab configuration to indicate when truncated messages exist in files from which you are retrieving data, at which time Message Analyzer switches to a pared-down truncation parser set. You have the option to unselect this check box or to select it manually if Message Analyzer did not automatically detect truncated messages.

## Sharing Infrastructure
 Message Analyzer provides a **[Sharing Infrastructure](sharing-infrastructure.md)** that enables you to download default user asset collections to your local Libraries for manipulating and viewing data; this also includes downloading OPN packages for parsing messages that you capture with Message Analyzer. You can synchronize these collections and packages for automatic updates that are periodically pushed out by a Microsoft web service to the default **Message Analyzer** subscriber feed. You can view this feed from the **Asset Manager** dialog, which is accessible from the global Message Analyzer **Tools** menu. Because the user **Libraries** are integrated with the Sharing Infrastructure, you can import, export, and share these items with others, including any that you create or modify. Library item types include **Message Analyzer Trace Scenarios**, **Message Analyzer Filters**, **Message Analyzer Chart View Layouts**, **Message Analyzer Color Rules**, **Message Analyzer Profiles**, **Message Analyzer Viewpoints**, and so on. To enable sharing these Library items, you can configure your own user feeds or post items to a user file share. You can also manage all user Library types with the common and centralized management dialog.

 Other prominent Message Analyzer capabilities include the following:

-   **[Configuring a Remote Capture](configuring-a-remote-capture.md)**  — capture remote traffic on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows 10 hosts.   Use the **Remote Network Interfaces** **Trace Scenario** with the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider to target one or more computers with supported operating systems for remote capture in a Live Trace Session.

-   **[Configuring Host Adapter and Hyper-V-Switch Filters](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-windows-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md#BKMK_HostSwitchFilterConfig)**  — capture traffic from one or more host adapters and/or virtual machines (VMs) that are serviced by a Hyper-V Switch on remote Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows 10 hosts, or on the local computer. Customize the capture configuration by specifying packet traversal paths on  switch extension layers and on the NDIS driver filter stack, along with configuring other special filters, such as packet **Truncation**, **EtherType**, and **IP Protocol Number** filters through use of the **Advanced Settings - Microsoft-Windows-NDIS PacketCapture** dialog.

-   **[Processing MOF-Generated Events](message-analyzer-tutorial.md#BKMK_MOFProviders)**  — fully parse messages that are captured by Message Analyzer from MOF-instrumented providers. Message Analyzer supports registered event providers on your system that use the MOF schema as the basis of generating their events.

-   **[Processing WPP-Generated Events](loading-wpp-generated-events.md)** — parse and display Windows software trace preprocessor (WPP)-generated events. Because such events make use of the ETW framework, Message Analyzer can capture them live or load them from a saved event trace log (ETL) file.  To enable parsing of WPP-generated events, users must provide supplementary information that defines the WPP event structure.

-   **[PEF-WFP Fast Filters](pef-wfp-fast-filters.md)**  — specify **Fast Filters** for the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** in a **Loopback and Unencrypted IPSEC** trace.

-   **[PEF-NDIS Fast Filters](pef-ndis-fast-filters.md)**  — configure logically chained **Fast Filter** groups that you assign to host adapters by using the **Advanced Settings - Microsoft-PEF-NDIS PacketCapture** dialog in a **Local Network Interfaces** trace on Windows 8 and earlier hosts.

-   **[Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture Provider](microsoft-windows-ndis-packetcapture-provider.md)**  — enabled for capturing remote traffic, with support for capturing from VMs that are managed by a Hyper-V-Switch. Also supports advanced filtering that includes packet direction, NDIS stack, and Hyper-V extension layer filters.

-   **[Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider](microsoft-pef-wfp-messageprovider.md)**  — since Message Analyzer v1.3, the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** has had the capability to capture messages from remote computers that are running the Windows 10 operating system. You can capture this data in any **Trace Scenario** that uses this provider by starting a Live Trace Session from any computer that is running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or the Windows 10 operating system.

-   **[Capturing in Promiscuous Mode (P-Mode)](configuring-a-remote-capture.md#BKMK_PromiscuousMode)**  — configure the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider to capture local or remote traffic on network adapters that support p-mode by simply selecting supporting adapters  in the interface selection list of the [Advanced Settings - Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-windows-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md) dialog.

-   **[Filtering Language](writing-filter-expressions.md)**  — discover how to write your own Filter Expressions for filtering data that is loaded into Message Analyzer, captured live, or analyzed after trace results are complete.

-   **[ResponseTime](average-response-time-for-operations.md)**  — add this **Global Annotation** entity from the **Field Chooser** as a data column in the **Analysis Grid** viewer. Enables you to measure the time interval between a request operation to a server and the first server response, to provide a context for assessing server performance.

-   **[OPN Definitions](viewing-opn-source-code.md)**  — display OPN definitions for capture modules or message fields from the **Analysis Grid** viewer or **Details** window context menu, respectively.

-   **[Analysis Grid Toolbar Features](analysis-grid-viewer.md#BKMK_AnalysisGridToolbar)**  — the **Analysis Grid** viewer now provides a toolbar for quick access to tools that assist in common analysis tasks.

-   **[Grouping Viewer](grouping-viewer.md)**  — select the **Grouping** viewer to organize your traffic into summary group hierarchies that expose targeted information that you can quickly extract from a large data set, which can otherwise be difficult to achieve.

-   **[Track Fields and Properties](message-details-tool-window.md#BKMK_UsingDetailsTracking)**  — a **Details** window feature that exposes the values of message-specific  fields, along with the additional global message properties and global annotations that are generated by Message Analyzer, to enable you to do the following from the **Details** window context menu:

    -   Utilize these new entities when configuring filters, groupings, adding columns, and so on.

    -   Track any message field, global property, or global annotation value — this enables you  to compare the value of the same field or property in other messages that you select or scroll to in the **Analysis Grid** viewer.

-   **[Pattern Match Viewer](pattern-match-viewer.md)**  — enables you to execute predefined **Pattern** expressions that locate message sequences or patterns that occur across a set of trace results, for example, a **TCP Three-Way Handshake** pattern. Also provides facilities for creating your own **Pattern** expressions, with or without user interface automation assistance.

-   **[Parse As](setting-message-analyzer-global-options.md)**  — a global **Options** dialog feature that enables you to parse an existing set of trace results with a different port value, for example, one that deviates from a standard port value for a particular protocol. Accommodates traces that used alternate port values for security purposes.

## Important for Network Monitor Users
 Microsoft       Message Analyzer dramatically extends the network traffic diagnostics and analysis capabilities of Microsoft Network Monitor. This is enabled by a diverse set of data viewers and graphical view **Layouts** that create high-level data summaries; top-level messages and Operations with message stack and fragment encapsulation; **Viewpoints**, **Profiles**, and **Diagnosis** messages; and so on. In addition, Message Analyzer implements  former Network Monitor features that enable you to do the following:

-   Correlate process name and process ID data natively in Message Analyzer.

-   Simulate the Network Monitor message display with the Message Analyzer **Flat Message List** feature.

-   Simulate the Network Monitor **Network Conversations** tree with the Message Analyzer **Grouping** viewer.
