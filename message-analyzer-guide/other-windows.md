# Other Windows

This section describes several other **Tool Windows** that you will make regular use of in Message Analyzer, which include the following:  
  
-   **Field Chooser Tool Window** — provides message hierarchies in tree grid format to assist in configuration tasks where field selection is required, for example, when creating **Pattern** expressions, **Charts**, and **Unions**, or when adding new data columns to the **Analysis Grid** viewer default column layout or new Groups to the **Grouping** viewer.  
  
-   **Output Tool Window** — provides the output of the Message Analyzer log, as a convenience, to enable you to monitor Message Analyzer start up routines such as loading parser modules. Any errors that occur are highlighted in red in this window, which is useful information if you want to file a bug (click **Report a bug** in the **Feedback** drop-down menu). Also displays other data such as .cap file export statistics.  
  
-   **Session Explorer Tool Window** — enables you to navigate among session and viewer nodes in Live Trace Session and Data Retrieval Session results, provides a context menu for opening new data viewers, and also displays session progress indications and other statistics.  
  
-   **Map Tool Window** — provides a high-level view of data points along with a navigation control that enables you to focus on the data field locations that contain the messages you want to analyze in a supporting primary data viewer that contains map style visualizations.  
  
You can display any of these windows by selecting them in the **Windows** submenu that is accessible from the global Message Analyzer **Tools** menu, if they are not already displayed. Note that the **Field Chooser** window is also accessible from the **Pattern Editor**, the **Edit Union** dialog, and when creating and editing **Charts**.  
  
The indicated **Tool Windows** are described in the following topics of this section:
