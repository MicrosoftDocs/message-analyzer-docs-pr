# Message Analyzer Community Additions

At the end of each topic in the Message Analyzer Operating Guide, there is a **Community Additions** section where you can start a comment and response thread. If you provide a comment, question, or legitimate concern that is not spam, you will receive direct feedback from Microsoft. To get started, you simply click the **ADD** link in the **Community Additions** section. Note that you will be prompted to specify Microsoft account credentials before you can proceed. Thereafter, a **Community Additions** page displays with text boxes that enable you to specify a title and the content for your community entry. When complete, you simply click the **Submit** button and your entry will appear in the **Community Additions** section at the end of the topic for which you provided comments.
