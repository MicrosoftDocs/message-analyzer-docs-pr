# Saving Message Data

After you have loaded data through a Data Retrieval Session or captured data in a Live Trace Session and displayed it in a viewer such as the **Analysis Grid** viewer, in most cases you will manipulate the data in some way to isolate specific information and analyze the issues on which you are working. For example, you might have modified your Data Retrieval Session or Live Trace Session results data in one or more of the following ways:  
  
-   Displayed additional message fields by adding specific columns to the **Analysis Grid** viewer to contain new field data.  
  
-   Applied a view **Filter** to isolate specific message data.  
  
-   Created **Color Rules** for a data set, to highlight messages based on various protocol names, field values, states, and so on.  
  
-   Set **Viewpoints** or changed a viewer **Layout**.  
  
However, although you may have modified your data display in an Analysis Session, Message Analyzer will allow you to save only certain settings that you configured for a set of trace results. These settings include the following:  
  
-   **Filtered data** — you can save the results of applying a view **Filter** to a set of messages. You can also save the results that display in a separate **Analysis Grid** viewer tab, for example, a set of messages that display in an **Analysis Grid** viewer tab after you have double-clicked a visualizer component in another data viewer such as the **Protocol Dashboard** or some **Chart** viewer **Layout**.  
  
-   **Selected messages** — you can save any set of messages that are currently highlighted.  
  
-   **Bookmarks** — you can save bookmarks that you configured in a set of trace results, but only if you save your data in the Message Analyzer native .matp format.  
  
-   **Comments** — you can save comments that you configured in a set of trace results, but only if you save your data in the Message Analyzer native .matp format.  
  
-   **Time Shifts** — you can save a **Time Shift** that you applied in a set of trace results, but only if you save your data in the Message Analyzer native .matp format.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In a future release of Message Analyzer, you may be able to save more settings.
