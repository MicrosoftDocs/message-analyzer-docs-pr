# Starting a Custom Trace Scenario

After you have created a trace template and saved it as a **Trace Scenario** in the **Trace Scenarios** Library, you can access the scenario and run it as needed. To do so, you will load your custom **Trace Scenario** into a Live Trace Session configuration by clicking it in the Library. You can then start the session as you would any Live Trace Session, by clicking the **Start** button in the **New Session** dialog. Note that it is unnecessary to specify a data viewer in which to display your trace results prior to starting your session, as  your custom scenario will use whichever data viewer was specified in the **Start With** drop-down list at the time you saved the scenario. However, note that you still have the option to select a different data viewer prior to starting your Live Trace Session.
