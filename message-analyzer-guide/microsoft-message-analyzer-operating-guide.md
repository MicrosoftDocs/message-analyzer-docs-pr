|![Message Analyzer](media/fig-x-messageanalyzericon.png "Fig-x-MessageAnalyzerIcon")|**Important** <br />Microsoft Message Analyzer (MMA) is being retired and its download packages removed from microsoft.com sites on November 25 2019.  There is currently no Microsoft replacement for Microsoft Message Analyzer in development at this time. If you already have Microsoft Message Analyzer installed, you may continue to use it, along with the OPN parsers you have already downloaded. Parsing ETW traces will also continue to work as before. After November 25 2019 when MMA is launched, it will attempt to connect to the back-end Feed service to check News and Assets updates and an error message will appear. To dismiss this error message, see [Dismiss Error Message](procedures-using-the-asset-management-features.md#BKMK_DismissError).<br /><br />**Introduction** <br />Microsoft Message Analyzer is a tool for capturing, displaying, and analyzing protocol messaging traffic, events, and other system or application messages in network troubleshooting and other diagnostic scenarios. Message Analyzer also enables you to load, aggregate, and analyze data from log and saved trace files. It is the successor to *Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4* and is a key component in the Protocol Engineering Framework (PEF) that was created by Microsoft to improve protocol design, development, implementation testing and verification, documentation, and support. With Message Analyzer, you can choose to capture local and remote traffic live or load archived message collections from multiple data sources simultaneously.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Message Analyzer enables you to display trace, log, and other message data in numerous data viewer formats, including a default tree-grid view, interactive Tool Windows, and other selectable graphical view **Layouts** that employ grids, bar element, timeline, and other visualizer components that provide high-level data summaries and other prominent statistics. You also have the option to configure your own custom **Layouts** for the **Chart** viewer. In addition, Message Analyzer now  provides a **Profiles** feature, which creates interactive and integrated analysis environments that automatically display preset viewer and **Layout** configurations when data from specific input file types is loaded.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> **Quick Links** <br />  **[New Features and Updates](new-features-and-updates.md)**  — find out what's new in the latest release of Microsoft Message Analyzer.<br />**[Message Analyzer User Roles](message-analyzer-user-roles.md)** — determine your User Role and navigate to topics that help you get started with Message Analyzer in your role.<br />**[Message Analyzer Tutorial](message-analyzer-tutorial.md)** — take a detailed tour of Message Analyzer to learn about its capabilities, functions, and features.<br />**[Quick Session Startup](quick-session-startup.md)** — start a new Message Analyzer local trace session with a single click.<br />**[Procedures: Quick Start](procedures-quick-start.md)** — see Message Analyzer in action right now by running several simple procedures.<br />**[Important for Network Monitor Users](message-analyzer-feature-summary.md#BKMK_NetmonUsers)** — review information about the differences between Network Monitor and Message Analyzer.<br />**[Feedback](message-analyzer-community-additions.md)** — provide feedback on any topic in this Operating Guide.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> **Other Links** <br />  **[Installing and Upgrading Message Analyzer](installing-and-upgrading-message-analyzer.md)**  — get a *free download* and install or upgrade Message Analyzer on your system. <br />**[Starting Message Analyzer for the First Time](installing-and-upgrading-message-analyzer.md#BKMK_StartingMAFirstTime)** — learn about how to run Message Analyzer as an Administrator, security contexts and restrictions, and syncing Message Analyzer assets for automatic updates.<br />**[Training Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLszrKxVJQz5Uwi90w9j4sQorZosTYgDO4)** — view several supplemental training videos to help you get started with Microsoft Message Analyzer.<br />**[Participating in the Message Analyzer Community](participating-in-the-message-analyzer-community.md)** — review options for participating in various Message Analyzer community venues.<br />**[Download PDF](/message-analyzer/opbuildpdf/toc.pdf?branch=live)** — download a PDF copy of this Operating Guide.|
