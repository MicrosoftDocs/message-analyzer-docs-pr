# Built-In Trace Scenarios
All Message Analyzer installations include a built-in set of predefined **Trace Scenarios** that together provide you with a large range of tracing functionality, applicability, and usefulness. These scenarios can help you get started very quickly with capturing and processing live data. For example, you can simply select a built-in **Trace Scenario** and then start your Live Trace Session with no additional configuration required. However, the quickest way to start a Live Trace Session is to click the **Start Local Trace** button on the **Start Page** to immediately begin capturing network messages on your local computer at the Data Link Layer and above by using the **Local Network Interfaces** scenario. Other quick start methods that you can use to immediately launch a Live Trace Session and start capturing live data consist of the following:  
  
-   Click one of the built-in **Trace Scenarios** in the **Favorite Scenarios** submenu, which is accessible from the Message Analyzer **File** menu.  
  
-   Click one of the built-in **Trace Scenarios** in the **Favorite Scenarios** list, which is accessible from the Message Analyzer **Start Page**.  
  
## Trace Scenarios Library  
 Message Analyzer maintains all items of the **Message Analyzer Trace Scenarios** asset collection in a Library that is accessible to the Message Analyzer Sharing Infrastructure, where you can auto-synchronize with collection updates that are pushed out by a Microsoft web service or manually download them as required with the use of the **Asset Manager**, which is accessible from the global Message Analyzer **Tools** menu. The built-in **Trace Scenarios** utilize different combinations of providers to achieve specific results that are useful in common network, component, and device troubleshooting scenarios. You also have the option to specify your own provider combinations, by adding more providers to a built-in **Trace Scenario** or by specifying chosen system ETW Providers for a custom **Trace Scenario** that you create.  
  
 Some examples of how you might customize ETW-instrumented message provider combinations consist of using the following:  
  
-   A single PEF provider, such as the **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider or the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** in a standalone configuration.  
  
-   The **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider in a standalone configuration.  
  
-   A PEF provider and a combination of one or more Windows system ETW providers.  
  
-   The **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider and a combination of one or more Windows system ETW providers.  
  
-   One or more Windows system ETW providers.  
  
## Operating System Dependencies  
 The built-in **Trace Scenarios** and the providers they utilize for capturing data are described in this section. Note that the **Trace Scenarios** that are available in the **Select Scenario** drop-down list in the **New Session** dialog are specific to the supported operating system you are running. For example, the **Local Network Interfaces** **Trace Scenario** in the **Network** category on computers running the Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows Server 2012 operating system, uses the **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider; while computers running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, or later operating system use the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider in the **Local Network Interfaces** **Trace Scenario**. In Message Analyzer, when a **Trace Scenario** has an operating system dependency, it is specified as part of the scenario name in the **Select Scenario** drop-down list or it is included in the scenario description. In any case, the **Select Scenario** drop-down list in the **New Session** dialog will never contain any **Trace Scenarios** that do not apply to the supported operating system your computer is running.  
  
 Whenever you select a scenario in the **Select Scenario** drop-down list on the **Live Trace** tab of the **New Session** dialog, the providers that are included in each scenario display in the **ETW Providers** list, along with their **Ids** or globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). A short description of each **Trace Scenario** in this user Library is also included below the scenario name, and when there are environment differences, the operating system that supports the scenario is typically specified.  
  
## Configuring Remote vs Local Traces  
 There are differences in the way you can configure the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** and **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** providers prior to running a trace, as follows:  
  
-   **Remote trace scenarios with the Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider — in remote scenarios that use this provider, you can specify the *remote* host adapters and/or virtual machine (VM) adapters from which to capture messages, the manner in which packets traverse the NDIS stack layers or Hyper-V-Switch extension layers on such remote adapters, respectively, and various unique filters such as **Truncation**, **EtherTypes**, and **IP Protocol Numbers**. You can configure these settings from the **Advanced Settings - Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider dialog, as described in [Using the Advanced Settings - Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture Dialog](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-windows-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Although the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider has remote capabilities, its ability to capture message data on local hosts is utilized in several other Message Analyzer **Trace Scenarios**, for example, when capturing messages at the Data Link Layer in the **Local Network Interfaces (Win 8.1 and later)** scenario.  
  
-   **Local trace scenarios with the Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider — in local scenarios that use this provider, you can specify local adapters from which to capture messages, the direction in which to capture them, and you can create up to two logically-chained **Fast Filter Groups** that you can assign to any selected adapter. You can configure these settings from the **Advanced Settings - Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** dialog, as described in [Using the Advanced Settings - Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture Dialog](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-pef-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In Message Analyzer v1.3 and later, the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** has the capability to capture messages from remote computers that are running the Windows 10 operating system. You can capture this data in any **Trace Scenario** that uses this provider by starting your Live Trace Session with this scenario from any computer that is running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server R2, Windows 10, or later operating system.  
  
## Built-In Trace Scenario Descriptions  
 The built-in **Message Analyzer Trace Scenarios** asset collection items that are included with every Message Analyzer installation are described in the table that follows, along with a functional description and possible usage for each scenario.  
  
### Table 4.  Message Analyzer Built-In Trace Scenarios  
  
|Trace Scenario|Provider Names|Functional Description|Possible Usage Configurations|  
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
|***Network Category***||||  
|**Local Network Interfaces (Win 8 and earlier)** <br /> Capture local Link Layer traffic from NDIS. OS:  Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.|Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture|Provides the capability to capture local traffic on the indicated operating systems at the Data Link Layer (wire level), which is the lowest available chokepoint in the network stack.  Also enables you to configure **Fast Filters** that do the following:<br /><br /> - Target specific packet data.<br /><br /> - Reduce CPU processing and consumption of resources by passing less data.<br /><br /> - Prevent higher disk I/O overhead.<br /><br /> - Improve speed by avoiding filtering at the parsing engine level.<br /><br /> Note that packets captured at the Data Link Layer can be encrypted by a protocol such as IPsec, which obfuscates cleartext transmissions. Also, data obtained from the **Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider can be noisy, especially on a wireless connection, because it captures broadcast and other traffic below the Network layer.|You might use the **Local Network Interfaces** scenario if you want to:<br /><br /> - Capture raw data on the wire, such as Ethernet frames.<br /><br /> - Specify the configuration of adapters from which to capture data.<br /><br /> - Specify light-weight **Fast Filters** that enable you to locate messages that contain specified offset length patterns (OLP) or messages intended for specified target addresses. You can logically chain up to 3 **Fast Filters** within two separate filter **Groups** which you can then apply to selected adapters.<br /><br /> ____________________<br /><br /> **More Information** <br /> **To learn more** about configuring these settings, see [Using the Advanced Settings - Microsoft-PEF-NDIS-PacketCapture Dialog](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-pef-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md). <br />____________________|  
|**Local Network Interfaces (Win 8.1 and later)** <br />Capture local Link Layer traffic from NDIS. OS: Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows 10.|Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture|Provides the capability to capture local traffic at the Data Link Layer on computers running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, and later operating systems. Also enables you to capture local VM traffic on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012 computers.<br /><br /> Configuration features include  special **Filters** that do the following:<br /><br /> - Truncate packets to reduce bandwidth consumption.<br /><br /> - Establish how packets traverse the NDIS filter stack.<br /><br /> - Isolate Ethernet frames that contain IP packets such as IPv4 and IPv6.<br /><br /> - Filter for and return only IP packets that have certain payloads, for example, TCP, UDP, or ICMP.<br /><br /> - Filter traffic based on one or more specified MAC or IP addresses.|You might use the **Local Network Interfaces** scenario on a local computer running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, or later operating system if you want to:<br /><br /> - Capture raw data on the wire, such as Ethernet frames.<br /><br /> - View only the packet headers for a particular protocol, through truncation.<br /><br /> - Monitor NDIS filter layers to determine whether packets are being dropped.<br /><br /> - Specify the direction in which packets traverse the NDIS filter layers, to isolate inbound or outbound traffic.<br /><br /> - Filter for packets that are intended for a particular address or that contain specific payload types.<br /><br /> **Tip:** You can use the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider to capture traffic from  not only local computers but remote computers as well. See [Using the Advanced Settings - Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture Dialog](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-windows-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md) for more information.|  
|**Loopback and Unencrypted IPSEC** <br />Captures above IPv4/IPv6 layer using the Windows Filtering Platform. Exposes loopback traffic in two directions and unencrypted IPSEC traffic. OS: Windows 7 and later.|Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider|The WFP capture system does the following in this scenario:<br /><br /> - Captures loopback traffic and unencrypted IPsec traffic.<br /><br /> - Supports data capture at various points in the Windows kernel TCP/IP stack, for example, above the IP/Network layer.<br /><br /> - Logs structured packet data as ETW events for application protocol analysis and traffic monitoring.<br /><br /> - Provides raw binary data.<br /><br /> - Enables you to configure **Fast Filters** that focus the retrieval action of the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider**.<br /><br /> - Enables you to log discarded packet events.<br /><br /> **Note:** If you select the **Select Discarded Packet Events** check box on the **Provider** tab in the **Advanced Settings – Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** dialog, any **Fast Filter** or **WFP Layer Set** filter that you have also specified will not apply to packet events that are discarded.|You might use the **Loopback and Unencrypted IPSEC** scenario with the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** if you want to:<br /><br /> - Focus on troubleshooting local application communication issues via loopback traffic, for example, between a SQL Server and a web server.<br /><br /> - Focus on troubleshooting IP security issues by capturing and analyzing unencrypted IPSec traffic.<br /><br /> - Isolate traffic above the IP/Network layer and minimize broadcast and other lower-layer noise.<br /><br /> - Isolate inbound or outbound TCP/IP traffic for IPv4 and IPv6.<br /><br /> - Specify light-weight port and address **Fast Filters** that enable you to select specific messages to capture.<br /><br /> - Troubleshoot discarded packet issues.<br /><br /> - Target a computer running the Windows 10 operating system for remote capture in a Message Analyzer v1.3 or later installation, from a computer that is running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server R2, or Windows 10 operating system.<br /><br /> **Tip:** You can also use the **New-PefTargetHost** PowerShell cmdlet to capture traffic on a remote Windows 10 computer with the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider**. **For more information**, see [Automating Tracing Functions with PowerShell](automating-tracing-functions-with-powershell.md).|  
|**Pre-Encryption for HTTPS** <br />Capture HTTPS client-side unencrypted traffic by using the **Web Proxy**-Fiddler provider.|Microsoft-PEF-WebProxy|Provides the ability to capture Application Layer/HTTP client-side browser traffic prior to encryption. The **Pre-Encryption for HTTPS** **Trace Scenario** does not capture data from lower layers, such as the Transport layer or below. As a result, you may not capture all HTTP traffic of interest unless you run a **Loopback and Unencrypted IPSEC** or **Local Network Interfaces** trace.<br /><br /> Note that the **Microsoft-Pef-WebProxy** provider will not capture traffic to and from a web browser unless you configure **Internet options** to use a proxy server for the LAN.<br /><br /> **Important:** To use the **Microsoft-Pef-WebProxy** provider, you must have the Fiddler library from Telerik installed. If you have not already installed this library, you can download it [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523815). For more information, see [Microsoft-PEF-WebProxy Provider](microsoft-pef-webproxy-provider.md).|You might use the **Pre-Encryption for HTTPS** scenario if you need to:<br /><br /> - Capture all HTTP traffic to and from a web browser in unencrypted format.<br /><br /> - Troubleshoot Web server and client performance issues.<br /><br /> - Filter HTTP traffic based on a hostname URL or a particular port number, such as 80 or 443.<br /><br /> - View various sets of HTTP statistics, such as the number of requests and responses, reason phrases, status codes, IDs, host URIs, ports, query strings, server response times, and so on.<br /><br /> - Specify a security certificate to capture HTTPS traffic on a particular site where it is necessary for Fiddler to provide such a certificate.<br /><br /> - Configure Fiddler to reuse client and/or server connections for performance improvements.|  
|**Local Loopback Network** <br />Capture loopback network traffic that references the loopback addresses of 127.0.0.1 and ::1. If the traffic uses one of the local IP addresses, the scenario should be updated to include that address. Display addresses with the `IPConfig /all` command.|Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider|Passes only loopback traffic that uses the IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses. Will also include loopback traffic that uses a local IP address if you specify a **Fast Filter** that contains that address.|The provider configuration for this scenario, which includes the use of the **Advanced Settings – Microsoft-Pef-WFP-MessageProvider** dialog, enables you to do the following:<br /><br /> - Focus on troubleshooting local application communication issues via loopback traffic, for example, between a SQL Server and a web server.<br /><br /> - Focus on inbound loopback traffic only for IPv4 and IPv6.|  
|**Network Tunnel Traffic and Unencrypted IPSEC** <br />Capture network traffic in the VPN/DirectAccess tunnel by using the Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider. Also capture unencrypted IPSEC traffic.|Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider|In this scenario, the Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider captures VPN, Direct Access, and IPSEC traffic. You can also use this scenario to remove loopback traffic. However, you must manually specify **Fast Filters** for IPv4 and IPv6 to remove the loopback traffic, for example, specify `!127.0.0.1` for the IPv4 filter and `!::1` for the IPv6 filter.<br /><br /> You can also realize improved performance in this scenario because it excludes traffic from the Network   Layer and below.|The provider configuration for this scenario, which includes the use of the **Advanced Settings – Microsoft-Pef-WFP-MessageProvider** dialog, enables you to do the following:<br /><br /> - Focus on troubleshooting network tunnel traffic.<br /><br /> - Focus on troubleshooting IP security issues by capturing unencrypted IPSEC traffic.<br /><br /> - Isolate traffic above the IP/Network layer, and minimize broadcast and other lower-layer noise.<br /><br /> - Isolate inbound or outbound TCP/IP traffic for IPv4 and IPv6.<br /><br /> - Specify light-weight port and address **Fast Filters** that enable you to select specific messages to capture.<br /><br /> - Target a computer running the Windows 10 operating system for remote capture in a Message Analyzer v1.3 or later installation, from a computer that is running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server R2, or Windows 10 operating system.|  
|**Pre-Encrypted HTTPS Direct** <br />Captures HTTP directly from the Microsoft-Windows-WinInet provider for enhanced HTTPS troubleshooting. OS: Windows 10 and later.|Microsoft-Windows-WinInet-Capture|To capture HTTPS traffic with this scenario, you must be running Message Analyzer with elevated (Administrative) privileges.<br /><br /> Use as an alternative to the **Microsoft-PEF-WebProxy**/Fiddler provider in the **Pre-Encryption for HTTPS** scenario, to allow better interoperability with web servers that require security certificates. This is because the **Microsoft-Windows-WinInet** provider captures HTTPS request and response messages as events, at a place where encrypted packets are already decoded.<br /><br /> The WinInet provider enables you to filter for events based on **Keyword** and **Level** configurations only, as specified in the **Advanced Settings – Microsoft-Windows-WinInet** dialog for this provider.|The provider configuration for this scenario, which includes use of the **Advanced Settings – Microsoft-Windows-WinInet** dialog, enables you to do the following:<br /><br /> - Capture data live with Message Analyzer in the **Pre-Encrypted HTTPS Direct** scenario, or use Windows in-box tools such as NetSh or Logman to capture HTTPS messages unencrypted and generate an ETL file that you can load and parse with Message Analyzer.<br /><br /> **Note:** The **Microsoft-Windows-WinInet** provider is included with every installation of the Windows 10 operating system.<br /><br /> - Better accommodate some web server configurations that are less friendly to the **Windows-PEF-WebProxy**/Fiddler provider in the **Pre-Encryption for HTTPS** scenario.<br /><br /> - Capture HTTPS traffic directly with computers that restrict Fiddler installations.<br /><br /> Specify provider **Level** and/or **Keyword** filter settings, such as:<br /><br /> - Event packets that contain **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning**, **Information**, or **Verbose** error details, as described in [System ETW Provider Event Keyword/Level Settings](system-etw-provider-event-keyword-level-settings.md).<br /><br /> -                    **WININET_KEYWORD_SEND** — enables you to filter for outbound event packets.<br /><br /> -                    **WININET_KEYWORD_RECEIVE** — enables you to filter for inbound event packets.<br /><br /> -                    **WININET_KEYWORD_PII_PRESENT** — enables you to filter for event packets that possibly contain private information.<br /><br /> -                    **WININET_KEYWORD_PACKET** — not used in this scenario.<br /><br /> -                    **Microsoft-Windows-WinInet-Capture/Analytic** — not used in this scenario.|  
|**Remote Network Interfaces** <br />Remote capture on Link Layer. OS: target machines with Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows 10.|Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture|Enables you to take advantage of the remote tracing capabilities of the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider to capture traffic on a remote computer running the Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, or later operating system at the Data Link Layer. With this provider, you  can do the following:<br /><br /> - Target specific remote hosts on which to capture traffic.<br /><br /> - Specify the remote host adapters and/or VM adapters on which to capture data.<br /><br /> - Create special packet and address filtering configurations.|You might use the **Remote Network Interfaces** scenario if you want to:<br /><br /> - Capture raw Ethernet frames remotely.<br /><br /> - Isolate traffic on a particular remote Windows 8.1,  Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows 10 host that you specify.<br /><br /> - Isolate traffic on a specified host adapter or VM adapter on a remote Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows 10 computer.<br /><br /> **Important:** If you want to capture traffic from a specific remote VM, you will need to select the VM in the tree grid section of the **Advanced Settings** dialog and then specify a filter based on the VM **MAC Address** to isolate the data. Otherwise, you may capture Hyper-V-Switch traffic that is destined for all VMs that are serviced by the switch, given that a Hyper-V-Switch driver cannot of itself distinguish between VMs.<br /><br /> - Specify packet traversal paths and filters for NDIS stack and Hyper-V-Switch extension layers, for example, when troubleshooting remotely dropped packets.<br /><br /> - Perform special filtering that isolates message headers, messages that contain a particular type of payload, or messages intended for a particular physical or network address.<br /><br /> ____________________<br /><br /> **More Information** <br /> **To learn more** about configuring these settings, see [Using the Advanced Settings - Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture Dialog](using-the-advanced-settings-microsoft-windows-ndis-packetcapture-dialog.md). <br />____________________<br /><br /> **Tip:** You can capture remote traffic with the **Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture** provider in promiscuous mode. For further details, see [Configuring a Remote Capture](configuring-a-remote-capture.md).|  
|**Remote Network Interfaces with Drop Information** <br /> Remote capture on Link Layer including event data to indicate dropped messages.  Truncation is set to 128 bytes.
