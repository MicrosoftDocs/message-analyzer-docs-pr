# Charts (Deprecated)

The **Charts (Deprecated)** viewers consist of those **Charts** that were available prior to the release of Message Analyzer version 1.4. You can still use these whenever you want, as they are still fully functional. Many of these **Charts**, or their components, are now represented as view **Layouts** that are accessible from the **Charts** drop-down in the **New Viewer** drop-down list. The paradigm changed to simplify things, so that there is now only one **Chart** viewer and many different types of **Layouts** that each use a single visualizer component such as a bar element or grid. For now, only the most popular of the former **Chart** viewers is included in this section for convenience, as indicated immediately below. It contains a combination of all the visualizer components available rather than a single component, as previously indicated.
