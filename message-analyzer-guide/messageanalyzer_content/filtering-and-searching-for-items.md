# Filtering and Searching For Items
The **Downloads** tab in the **Asset Manager** dialog displays all un-synced asset collection Libraries in a list, where the un-synced state is indicated by a server download status icon to the right of each collection. If the list of asset collections and **OPN Parser** packages becomes long and you want to quickly locate a particular collection, you can enter text in the search box that matches one or more characters or phrases in the name of the asset collection or parser package for which you are looking. If a match is found for the search text, the corresponding asset collection/s and parser package/s are displayed in the list of unsynced asset collections, while all other collections and parser packages are filtered out.  
  
 You can also filter for specific types of asset collections by selecting them by name from the **All asset types** drop-down list on the **Downloads** tab of the **Asset Manager**. For example, if you want to view only Filter collections on the **Downloads** tab, select **Filter** from the drop-down list. If you want to view only **OPN Parser** packages, select **OPN Package** from the drop-down list. To return to displaying all asset collections, which is the default setting, select **All asset types** from the drop-down list.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you auto-sync an asset collection Library, it is removed from the **Downloads** tab and appears on the **Settings** tab in the **Asset Manager** with the auto-sync status icon displaying to the right of that particular collection.
