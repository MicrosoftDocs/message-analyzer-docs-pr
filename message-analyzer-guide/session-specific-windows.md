# Session-Specific Windows

This section describes interactive **Tool Windows** that are *session-specific* and dockable windows, and which provide additional details for selected sessions. You can display the session-specific **Tool Windows** indicated below by selecting them in the **Windows** submenu that is accessible from the global Message Analyzer **Tools** menu, if they are not already displayed. However, for the **Diagnostics** **Tool Window** to appear in the **Windows** submenu, you must first enable it as a preview feature on the **Features** tab of the **Options** dialog, which is also accessible from the global Message Analyzer **Tools** menu. You must then restart Message Analyzer.  
  
 The following session-specific **Tool Windows** are described in this section:

- [Decryption Tool Window](decryption-tool-window.md)
