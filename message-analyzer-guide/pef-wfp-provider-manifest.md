# PEF-WFP Provider Manifest

The manifest for the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** defines its contract with an ETW Controller in terms of the events that are issued by the provider, which are in turn consumed by Message Analyzer. The **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** and its manifest are installed and registered on your machine when you install Message Analyzer. You can find the **Microsoft-PEF-WFP-MessageProvider** manifest in the following location:  
  
 `C:\Windows\System32\Microsoft-Pef-WFP-MessageCapture.man`  
  
 In this file you can view the event definitions, tasks, opcodes, keyword bitmask and level specifiers, a channel definition, and template information.
