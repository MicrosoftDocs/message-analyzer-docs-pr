# Gantt Viewer

Message Analyzer provides the **Gantt** viewer, which is currently a preview feature. If you wish to use the **Gantt** viewer, you will need to select its check box on the **Features** tab of the **Options** dialog, which is accessible from the global **Tools** menu, and then restart Message Analyzer. It will then be available for selection in the **New Viewer** drop-down list on the global Message Analyzer toolbar.  
  
## Understanding the Gantt Viewer  

 The **Gantt** viewer is an alternate graphic data visualizer that you can select when analyzing your message data. The **Gantt** viewer provides an at-a-glance view of message dispersion across a trace timeline that is presented as color-coded protocol module identifiers, with source/destination address message pairs in the y-axis orientation and timestamps in the x-axis orientation. The **Gantt** viewer also provides axis expansion and contraction controls to facilitate zooming into and out of data points. The **Gantt** viewer enables you to determine how long any operation takes to complete with respect to **Timestamp** axis values in the display and provides this data in the context of the completion times of other operations. The figure that follows shows an example of the **Gantt** viewer.

## Using the Toolbar Commands  

 To enhance data analysis capabilities the **Gantt** viewer toolbar provides the following features:  
  
-   **Edit** — click this button to open the **Gantt Configuration Editor** dialog, from where you can reconfigure the viewer layout, which includes the **Horizontal Axis** and **Vertical Axis** **Label** and **Layout** configuration; and the **Legend** and **Heatmap** configurations.  
  
-   **Load** — enables you to load data into the current **Gantt** viewer display from a previously saved .gantt file.  
  
-   **Save** — enables you to save data from the current **Gantt** viewer display to a .gantt file.  
  
-   **Select** mode — click this button to select single messages in the Gantt analysis surface, for example, to display message field information in the **Details** **Tool Window**. The **Select** mode works together with the **Box**, **Row**, and **Column** toolbar items, which you can click individually to alter the highlighting orientation of the selection feature, as described in [Using the Context Menu Commands](gantt-viewer.md#BKMK_ContextCommands).  
  
-   **Pan** — not used.  
  
-   **Zoom** mode — after clicking this button, you can zoom into one or more displayed messages by dragging a selection box around them, for example, to select a message and view **Details** and other data.  
  
-   **Box**, **Row**, and **Column** options — see the descriptions under **Selection Mode** in [Using the Context Menu Commands](gantt-viewer.md#BKMK_ContextCommands).  
  
-   **Heat** — click this button to display the **Heatmap Configuration** dialog, from where you can specify the following settings:  
  
    -   **Use Heatmap** — when you select this check box in the **Heatmap Configuration** dialog, the settings you make in the dialog take effect after you click **OK** to exit the dialog.  
  
    -   **Field** — by clicking the ellipsis (**…**) to the right of the **Field** text box, you can display the **Field Chooser** **Tool Window**, from where you can select an annotation, property, flag, or other data field for any message in the dialog that you want to highlight with **Heatmap** settings in the analysis surface.  
  
    -   **Observed** — provides an indication of the number of messages highlighted with the specified **Heatmap** settings.  
  
    -   **Minimum/Maximum Heat** — provides writeable text boxes in which you can specify **Minimum** and **Maximum** values for the **Heatmap** highlight settings.

## Using the Context Menu Commands  
 The **Gantt** viewer also provides several context menu commands that are available by right-clicking anywhere on the main analysis surface. The commands that display and the functions they perform are described as follows:  
  
-   **Mouse Mode** — provides a submenu that contains the **Select** and **Zoom** items, where one of these modes will always be selected.  
  
-   **Selection Mode** — provides a submenu that has the following options that you can use as indicated:  
  
    -   **Box** — sets the selection mode to the box shape for selecting one or more messages nodes.  
  
    -   **Row** — sets the selection mode to enable you to select messages in a **Source/Destination Pair** row orientation.  
  
    -   **Column** — sets the section mode to enable you to select messages in a **Timestamp** column orientation.  
  
-   **Zoom** — provides several **Zoom** presets that enable you to alter the data presentation to focus on one or more messages.  
  
-   **Settings** — enables you to change the data presentation format by alternately enabling or disabling various chart elements from submenu items that include **Fixed Grid**, **Auto Scroll**, and **Display Limit** settings.  
  
-   **View Message Range in ‘Analysis Grid’** — opens a selected range of messages in a separate instance of the **Analysis Grid** viewer.  
  
-   **View Time Range in ‘Analysis Grid’** — opens selected messages that fall within **Gantt** **Timestamp** column lines in a separate instance of the **Analysis Grid** viewer.  
  
-   **Add Rows to Filter** — enables you to create a view **Filter** from selected messages in particular rows.  
  
-   **Opaque Items** — enables you to alter the data presentation format by alternately applying and removing an opaque value to all message colors in the **Gantt** chart grid.  
  
## Legend  

 The **Gantt** viewer also contains a **Legend** that provides a list of check boxes that correspond to the protocols or modules for which messages were captured in the trace results displayed in the **Gantt** analysis surface. To focus on messages from one or more particular protocols or modules, unselect all the ones for which you do not want to view data.
