# Saving Trace Scenarios

When you are finished designing a trace template, you can save it as a custom **Trace Scenario** by clicking the **Save Scenario** button in the **New Session** dialog, at which time the **Edit Trace Scenario** dialog will display. In this dialog, you can specify a **Name** for the custom **Trace Scenario**, a **Description**, and add it to an existing **Category** or specify a new one. When you finish specifying your save configuration, click the **Save** button in the **Edit Trace Scenario** dialog to save your trace template as a new **Trace Scenario** item in the **Trace Scenarios** Library. The customized **Trace Scenario** that you are saving will be added to the **Trace Scenario** Library and will be available thereafter for selection from the **My Items** category of the **Select Scenario** drop-down list on the **Live Trace** tab of the **New Session** dialog during Live Trace Session configuration.  
  
 As part of this Library, your **Trace Scenario** template is accessible through the Message Analyzer Sharing Infrastructure. This infrastructure enables you to share your custom **Trace Scenario** templates with other team members and for others to share theirs with you.  
  
 For **Trace Scenario** Library items, the entry point into the Message Analyzer Sharing Infrastructure is accessed by clicking the **Manage Trace Scenarios** item in the **Select Scenario** drop-down menu on the **Live Trace** tab of the **New Session** dialog. When you do, the **Manage Trace Scenario** dialog displays all the **Trace Scenarios** in your Library in various categories, consisting of the default **Trace Scenarios** that are shipped with Message Analyzer, any **Trace Scenarios** that you have downloaded from Microsoft or imported through the Message Analyzer sharing infrastructure, along with any custom **Trace Scenarios** that you created. These custom **Trace Scenarios** will also be available for sharing with others through the Message Analyzer sharing infrastructure, through use of the **Export** feature in the **Manage Trace Scenario** dialog.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To save a custom **Trace Scenario**, follow the procedure specified in [Creating and Saving a Customized Trace Scenario](procedures-quick-start.md#BKMK_createSaveScenarioTemplate).
