# Retrieving Message Data

This section provides conceptual details about the Message Analyzer Browse-Select-View (BSV) model and how you can employ its features for rapid and convenient management and processing of the target data that you will load into Message Analyzer through a Data Retrieval Session. It also describes the features that you can use to configure and run a Data Retrieval Session, along with various methods you can use to load saved data directly into Message Analyzer without additional configuration.  
  
---  
  
 **Go To Session Configuration**   
Go directly to an overview of Data Retrieval Session configuration workflow, filtering options, and other features that are available for configuring and starting a new Data Retrieval Session:   
[Configuring a Data Retrieval Session](configuring-a-data-retrieval-session.md)

 **What You Will Learn**   
In the topics of this section, you will learn how to accomplish the tasks indicated below.  

---  
  
 **[Browse-Select-View Model](browse-select-view-model.md)**  — understand the BSV model and how to use it to configure a Data Retrieval Session.  
  
 **[Targeting Saved Data as an Input Source](targeting-saved-data-as-an-input-source.md)**  — read an introduction to starting, configuring, and optimizing a Data Retrieval Session that targets data from saved input files.  
  
 **[Configuring a Data Retrieval Session](configuring-a-data-retrieval-session.md)** — examine a Data Retrieval Session configuration workflow example, filtering options, and the tasks you can perform when configuring a new Data Retrieval Session, such as:  
  
-   Locating supported input file types and targeting the saved data they contain as input to Message Analyzer.  
  
-   Decrypting data from saved traces.  
  
-   Using filtering to select the type of data to retrieve from saved files.  
  
-   Specifying a viewer in which to analyze the retrieved data.  
  
-   Opening text logs and creating OPN configuration files for parsing custom text logs.  
  
-   Handling cloud data as input to Message Analyzer from Azure storage tables or from Azure logs that are stored in binary large object (BLOB) containers.  
  
-   Aggregating and merging multiple related log and trace files for cross-file data correlation and analysis.  
  
-   Loading data from ETL files that contain WPP-generated events.  
  
**[Performing Data Retrieval](performing-data-retrieval.md)**  — use different methods to perform data retrieval.  
  
**[Procedures: Using the Data Retrieval Features](procedures-using-the-data-retrieval-features.md)**  — perform example procedures that demonstrate the BSV model while encapsulating various aspects of data retrieval functionality.

 **More Information**   
 **To learn more** about configuring session scenarios and reconfiguring an existing Data Retrieval Session, see the following topics:  
[Configuring Session Scenarios with Selected Data Sources](configuring-session-scenarios-with-selected-data-sources.md)  
[Editing Existing Sessions](editing-existing-sessions.md)
