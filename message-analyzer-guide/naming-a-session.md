# Naming a Session

Although Message Analyzer provides a simple default name for each Data Retrieval Session, you can rename any session as a means of providing quick identification, for example, to reflect a particular issue on which you are working, the session configuration, or a data viewer that you used. You can specify a session name by entering one in the **Name** text box of the **New Session** dialog.  
  
## Identifying Sessions  

 Session names appear on all session tabs that display whenever you load data into Message Analyzer through a Data Retrieval Session or capture data through a Live Trace Session. Uniquely naming each session enables you to quickly identify and locate them in the **Session Explorer** **Tool Window** as named session nodes and as named session tabs below the global Message Analyzer toolbar during data analysis.  
  
## Changing Session Names  

 Prior to loading data into Message Analyzer, you can accept the default name that Message Analyzer provides for a Data Retrieval Session, or you can rename it at your discretion. After you load data into Message Analyzer, you have the option to change the name that you assign to a Data Retrieval Session by modifying it from the **Edit Session** dialog, which is accessible from the **Session** menu. Note that the session name can be different than the name of the file in which you save your session data. These behaviors also apply to a Live Trace Session.
