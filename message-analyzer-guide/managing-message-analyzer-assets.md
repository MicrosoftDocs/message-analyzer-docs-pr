# Managing Message Analyzer Assets

Message Analyzer provides an infrastructure that enables you to download, automatically update, and manage various types of assets that you commonly use in Message Analyzer operations. Some of the assets that you can use include view **Filters**, **Trace Scenarios**, **Analysis Grid** viewer **Layouts**, **Color Rules**, **Chart** viewer **Layouts**, **Viewpoints**, **OPN Parser** packages, and so on. With exception of the **OPN Parser** packages, these assets exist in user Libraries that are accessible from various locations in the Message Analyzer user interface. You can manage these assets from the **Asset Manager** dialog, which is accessible from the global Message Analyzer **Tools** menu. In the **Asset Manager** dialog, you will find asset collections such as **Message Analyzer Filters**, **Message Analyzer Chart View Layouts**, and others that are included in every Message Analyzer installation. All asset collections that appear in the **Asset Manager** can be synced for periodic updates from a Microsoft web service that automatically refreshes your Libraries with the latest collection items. The infrastructure also enables you to import and export asset collections or any portion thereof, from and to a user-designated file share location, respectively. You can also create your own feeds from the **Asset Manager** dialog. The framework that contains all these capabilities is known as the Message Analyzer Sharing Infrastructure.
